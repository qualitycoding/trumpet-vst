# Protocol extracts (planning protocol v3.2, verbatim)

These extracts let the implementer carry out S-000, S-RETRO, S-KNOW and test challenges without access to the protocol.
Copied mechanically from the protocol file, unchanged.

## 2E.4 Test Challenge Rule
4. **Test Challenge Rule:** If a frozen test or statement is found invalid during planning, discard the freeze and return to Phase 1 (re-research the claim behind it), then redo Phases 2–4. If found invalid during implementation, the implementer halts and writes `TEST_CHALLENGE.md` (item ID, evidence, proposed fix). The planning agent then runs an **amendment**: it re-runs only the challenged item and everything that depends on it (found through `plan/TRACEABILITY.md`), starting from the earliest phase the challenge affects (usually re-researching the claim in Phase 1), then re-freezes, re-runs the Phase 3.6 cold read and a Phase 4 pre-mortem round on the changed steps, and records the amendment as a decision `D-###`. The protocol is re-run from Phase 0 only if the challenge invalidates the Goal, Profiles, or Success Criteria.

## 3.7 Opening and closing steps
### 3.7 Opening and Closing Steps `[All]`
Every `plan/PLAN.md` begins with `S-000` and ends with `S-RETRO` and then `S-KNOW`. The closing steps come after every delivery step and depend on all steps before them.

**3.7.0 `S-000` Environment & Access Verification (Haiku).** The implementer's first step, before any delivery work:
1. Create the implementation branch `impl-<run_id>` from the generation branch; all implementation commits go there.
2. Run the setup commands in `plan/ENVIRONMENT.md`.
3. From the implementer's own environment, re-run the 0.1 checks for credentials, permissions, and host reachability.
4. Start `EXECUTION_LOG.md`: one line per step attempt, giving the UTC time, step ID, attempt number, outcome (`pass`, `fail`, or `blocked`), commit hash, and a short note. Every later step appends to it.
* **Done when:** every check passes. **On failure:** halt and write `BLOCKED.md` listing exactly what is missing, before any delivery work starts.

**3.7.1 `S-RETRO` Retrospective (Opus, fresh context).** Look back over the whole run and identify errors and overlooked steps. It is one pass over the records: a `Haiku` agent first collects the inputs into a single digest, and the retrospective re-runs nothing and changes no deliverable.
* **Inputs:** the execution history (`EXECUTION_LOG.md`, commits, `DEVIATIONS.md`, `BLOCKED.md`, `TEST_CHALLENGE.md`, and gate records `GATE-*.md`), step outcomes, retries and failures, CI history, `research/PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE.md`, and the lessons and knowledge items already recorded during the run, including the planning agent's.
* **Questions:**
  1. What went wrong, and what was corrected? Is every correction recorded as a lesson?
  2. What was overlooked: a step that should have been in the plan, a check that would have caught a problem sooner, or knowledge that had to be rediscovered?
  3. Which lessons loaded in R0 were not applied, or recurred anyway?
  4. Which new facts about the Subject are not yet knowledge items?
* **Outputs:** `RETROSPECTIVE.md`, with every finding linked to a lesson or knowledge ID; a new lesson (Rule 11) for every error or overlooked step not already recorded; a knowledge item (Rule 12) for every missing fact.
* **Done when:** every finding links to an `L-` or `K-` file, and the schema check in Appendix C passes.

**3.7.2 `S-KNOW` Lessons & Knowledge Push (Haiku), gate `G-003`.** Implementation is complete once `S-RETRO` is done; waiting at `G-003` holds back only this push.
1. Halt at `G-003`. Write `GATE-G-003.md` listing the lessons and knowledge items to push (IDs, titles, and tags), and request the target for the push, proposing the knowledge store recorded at intake. Allowed responses: `push-to-proposed`, `push-to: <target>`, or `do-not-push`.
2. On sign-off, copy `lessons/` and `knowledge/` into the target in the Appendix C layout, regenerate its indexes, and push. If the target does not exist yet, create it with the Appendix C layout and an empty `TAXONOMY.md` extended by the run's tags.
3. If the push is rejected because the target has moved on, pull, regenerate the indexes (entries are separate files, so they do not conflict), and retry, up to 3 times. If the push still fails, or the target is unreachable, or no response arrives, write `git bundle create knowledge-<run_id>.bundle` containing the lessons and knowledge commits, and report its path.
4. **Done when:** the push succeeded and the target's indexes list every pushed ID, or the response was `do-not-push`, or the bundle fallback (3) was written and reported.

These steps also push the planning agent's lessons and knowledge items, which travel on the generation branch.

## Appendix C: Knowledge Store `[All]`

**Layout.**
```
<store>/
  TAXONOMY.md                        Controlled vocabulary of tags, with aliases
  lessons/<primary-tag>/L-*.md       One file per lesson; <primary-tag> is its first tech: or domain: tag, else "general"
  lessons/INDEX.md                   Generated: tag -> lesson IDs, titles, severity (never edited by hand)
  knowledge/<subject>/K-*.md         One file per item, filed under its first subject: tag
  knowledge/INDEX.md                 Generated: tag -> item IDs and statements (never edited by hand)
```

**Tags.** Each lesson and item carries tags from these facets:
* `domain:` the problem domain, e.g. `domain:audio`, `domain:automotive`, `domain:quantum-gravity`;
* `tech:` a language, framework, library, tool, or platform, e.g. `tech:java`, `tech:maven`, `tech:juce`, `tech:github-actions`;
* `subject:` (knowledge items) the specific thing a fact is about, e.g. `subject:maven-central-publishing`;
* `phase:` where it applies: `intake`, `research`, `specification`, `planning`, `implementation`, `verification`, `release`, or `retrospective`;
* `kind:` (lessons) `wrong-assumption`, `environment`, `tooling`, `permissions`, `verification-gap`, `scope`, `process`, `integrity`, or `security`;
* `applies:all` for a lesson that applies to every task.

Use an existing tag (or one of its aliases in `TAXONOMY.md`) whenever one fits. A new tag is added to `TAXONOMY.md` in the same commit, never as a near-duplicate of an existing tag.

**Matching rule (R0).** A lesson or item is relevant when any of its `domain:`, `tech:`, or `subject:` tags equals one of the task's tags or an alias of one, or when it carries `applies:all`. Superseded and retired entries are not loaded.

**Schema check.** Every entry has all front-matter fields of its template; its `id` matches its file name; every tag has a known facet, and every knowledge item has a `subject:` tag; and no entry matches a secret pattern. Run this from the root of the working branch or the store; exit status 0 means every entry is valid:
```python
import pathlib, re, sys
REQUIRED = {
    "L": ["id", "title", "status", "supersedes", "recurrence_of", "occurrences", "severity", "tags", "recorded_by", "run", "recorded_at"],
    "K": ["id", "statement", "status", "supersedes", "tags", "applies_to_version", "source", "confidence", "derived_from", "discovered_by", "run", "recorded_at"],
}

    head = parts[1] if text.startswith("---") and len(parts) == 3 else ""
    fields = dict(re.findall(r"^(\w+):[ \t]*(.*)$", head, re.M))
    problems += [f"{path}: missing field '{f}'" for f in REQUIRED[path.name[0]] if f not in fields]
    if fields.get("id", "").split("#")[0].strip() != path.stem:
        problems.append(f"{path}: id does not match the file name")
    tags = re.findall(r"[\w-]+:[\w.-]+", fields.get("tags", ""))
    if not tags:

    problems += [f"{path}: unknown tag facet '{t}'" for t in tags if not t.startswith(FACETS)]

    if SECRET.search(text):
        problems.append(f"{path}: possible secret")
print("\n".join(problems) or "all entries valid")
